About
=====

A trivial Gtk# application, essentially a 'Hello world' for using Gtk# with C# threads.

Click the button to spin up a few C# threads, which then sleep for various numbers of seconds and then adjust the value of the slider.


Building
========

Included are the files needed to load the code as solution in MonoDevelop or Xamarin Studio.

Untested in Visual Studio, but the MonoDevelop solution *should* work as a VS2008 project ( see http://www.monodevelop.com/help/faq/ ).
